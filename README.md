# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description
This project explains a Simple Interest Calculator, which is used to calculate the simple interest based on principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Formula
Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## Parameters
- **Principal (P):** The initial amount of money
- **Rate (R):** Annual rate of interest
- **Time (T):** Time period in years

## Example
If:
- Principal = 10,000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Then:
Simple Interest = (10,000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 1,000

## Usage
This calculator can be used for basic financial calculations such as estimating interest on loans or savings.
